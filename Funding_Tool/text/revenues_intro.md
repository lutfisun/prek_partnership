**Purpose of This Tool:** This tool was designed to help you consider ways to make Pre-K Partnerships financially feasible for your center.

**Pre-K Partnerships**: A Success by 6 / AISD Collaboration (PKP), operated by United Way for Greater Austin (UWATX), is the authorized non-profit organization selected by Austin ISD to manage and oversee Pre-K Partnerships with high quality child development centers (CDC) in the Austin early childhood community.  CDCs meeting PKP program standards are invited to sign a partnership agreement with UWATX to provide Public Pre-K eligible children in their center with a 3-hour Pre-K program. Eligible children are co-enrolled at the CDC and Austin ISD and in turn, state funding is generated for every child co-enrolled at the center.  CDCs receive a portion of generated funding through this partnership to maintain program standards and center-wide quality efforts.  

UWATX is working to develop a suite of supports for all PKP centers.  These supports are generally not paid for with state funding and will be available as philanthropic funding is secured.  Benefits may include:

*	Substitute teaching pool
*	Mental Health Consultation services
*	On-site professional development opportunities
*	Shared services (such as business discounts, bulk discounts)
*	Supports for infant/toddler classrooms (such as professional development opportunities)
*	College loan forgiveness for PreK teachers 
*	Tuition reimbursement for graduate school for PreK teachers 
*	Classroom materials and supplies 
*	UWATX volunteer program supports
