An identified challenge of successful implementation of Pre-K Partnerships is the recruitment and retainment of a qualified teacher in partnership classrooms.  UWATX understands that every CDC has varying capacity for securing a teacher, so we want to provide options that meet your specific needs.  CDCs may opt to recruit and employ their own teacher OR contract with UWATX to employ a qualified teacher for your center.
