**Purpose of This Tool:** This tool was designed to help child care centers in the greater Austin area understand their costs and revenues for 3- and/or 4-year-old classrooms when partnering with a school district or charter school to provide public school pre-K.

**Background:** Child care/pre-K partnerships are a priority of multiple state agencies, local leaders, and early childhood stakeholders across Texas. School districts can provide public school pre-K for eligible 3- and 4-year-olds at a private child care center, rather than on an elementary campus. Children are dually enrolled in public school pre-K and child careâ€”the public school pre-K covers educational instruction while the subsidy or tuition covers wrap-around care (before and after school), all in the same location under the same teacher.
